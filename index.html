                The vehicle's electrical system (including the battery), the wireless service provider's signal and a
                connected mobile phone must all be available and operating for 911 Assist to function properly. These
                systems may become damaged in a crash. The paired mobile phone must be connected to SYNC, and the 911
                Assist feature enabled, in order for 911 to be dialed. When the feature is ON, 911 Assist uses your
                paired and connected mobile phone to assist occupants to contact emergency services by dialing 911 if
                your airbag deploys or, on certain vehicles, if the emergency fuel pump shut-off is activated.
                Aftermarket on-board diagnostic devices may interfere with various vehicle systems including Vehicle
                Health Report and 911 Assist. To avoid interference, remove the device or contact the device maker for
                more information on compatibility.
